# Analyzer Instructions

Follow the general repository guidelines in the root `AGENTS.md`.

## Task

1. Open `tests/test_analyzer.py` to understand the expected behavior.
2. Explore the sample code in `tests/sample_repo/`.
3. Implement a minimum viable analyzer in `my_mcp_server/analyzer.py` so that the tests pass.
4. Run the pre-commit checks and tests described in the root `AGENTS.md`.
5. Iterate on the implementation until the entire suite is green.
